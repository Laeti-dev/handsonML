This is a pratice for ML method, following Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron

Notes :
Exploring the data and understand which feature has importance, how features have been encoded.

Split data : respect the reality proportion to avoid a sampling bias. Use Stratify method on important features. Countinuous attributes should be classified and the proportion should be used to split our datas.
